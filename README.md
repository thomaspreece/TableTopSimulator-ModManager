# TTS Manager
This program is designed to allow you to manage mods in TTS using [ttsbackup](https://github.com/stefankendall/ttsbackup) and also search through a mod backup database and extract and install those mods to TTS too.

## Updating the Database
This program uses [TTSModsArchive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iAuPj1tmKSwg55m6ubM-CboegOzz9G_N) on Google Drive to find and download mods.

To update your local backup mods database run:
```
yarn mod_update
```
This will pull a new index file into `./mod_index.html` which is used to search for mods.

## (Optional) Download full mods archive
You can download a complete archive of all the mods listed in `./mod_index.html` from the [TTSModsArchive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iAuPj1tmKSwg55m6ubM-CboegOzz9G_N) google drive by opening the `Monthly` folder and downloading the large archive. This will avoid issues of downloading too many mods later and hitting googles rate limit.

Once you have downloaded the archive, you should extract it into this folder. You should now have a `./TTS_All_Workshop_Mods` folder and inside it, lots of 7z mod archives.

## Search mods
You can find mods by using:

```
yarn mod_search "STRING_TO_SEARCH_FOR"
```

e.g. to find Chess mods:
```
yarn mod_search "Chess"
```

And this will return:
```
